# CSC1109_Analysing_Spotify_Tracks
This is my epo for CSC1109 Data at Speed &amp; Scale - Assignment 1

The goal of this assignment is to load, clean and analyse a dataset using Pig and Hive on Hadoop MapReduce.

Given below are the steps taken to complete this assignment:
* Load and clean the dataset using Pig.
* Carry out two simple queries using Hive and repeat the same in Pig.
* Carry out three more complex queries using Hive where;
   1. Using a Hive function (Aggregate)
   2. Using a Join statement
   3. Using Bucket sampling
* Create visualisations using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn llibraries.
* Anlayse the results from each query.

Contents of this repo is as follows:

* [Data](data) - This folder contains the cleaned [Spotify Tracks Daatset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset/data).
* [Outputs](outputs) - This folder contains all data outputs from Pig and Hive queries.
* [Scripts](scripts) - This folder contains all the Pig and Hive scripts that were used to clean and run the simple and complex queries.
* [Visualisations](visualisations) - This folder contains the visualisations created from the complex Hive queries.
* [Jupyter notebook](notebook_query_visualisations.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook used to create the visualisations.
* [Documentation](https://github.com/tanuu1011/CSC1109_Analysing_Spotify_Tracks/blob/main/CSC1109%20Assignment%201%20-%20Tanuli%20Liyanage.pdf) - Documentation containing the analysis, observations and screenshots of the assignment.
